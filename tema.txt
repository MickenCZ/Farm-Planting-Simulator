Farm planting simulator

Canvas for background, svg for plants
semantic tags: game section, seeds seciton, save/load section, (maybe geolocation with weather info section)
header, footer, main, nav, aside, sectoin
CSS transitions: ig on a submit button or something

OOP: plant class and different other subclasses

if need different pages, one for visulisation of data or something
